# ML Model for Predicting Ships Crew Size

#### This was a takehome quiz for a Data Scientist interview

Date: 4/8/2019

We build a simple model using the cruise_ship_info.csv data set for predicting a ship's crew size. This project is organized as follows: (a) data proprocessing and variable selection; (b) basic regression model.

"cruise\_ship\_info.csv": dataset used for model building.
